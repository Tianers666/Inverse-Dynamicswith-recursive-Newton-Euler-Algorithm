# Inverse Dynamics with recursive Newton Euler Algorithm
Developed by: Xinyang Tian (2021).

Supervisor: Haolin Ma.

Platform: Matlab 2019b.

In this work, the dynamic model of a 7-DOF robot manipulator has been established. Two problems have been addressed:

Faster Inverse Dynamics: consists in comparing the effects of classical and modified Denavit-Hartenberg conventions using Newton-Euler algorithm. In particular, we focused on the required computational time.
Coefficients Identification: regards the design of some persistently exciting trajectories that allow to identify the dynamic coefficients of the manipulator. This topic is particularly interesting because the manufacturer did not publish the dynamic parameters, nor the dynamic coefficients.

# Implementation 
Please use matlab to run this script, the input parameters are q, qd, and qdd, the output parameters are seven torques corresponding to seven joints of the robot manipulator.
